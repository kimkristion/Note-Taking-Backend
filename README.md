# Note Taking: Backend 

This is the backend of a note-taking application that handles data storage and management. It uses Express.js to provide API routes for creating, retrieving, and deleting notes. Unique identifiers (UUIDs) generated with the 'uuid' module ensure each note has a distinct identity, facilitating efficient data handling.


## Description 
- The key motivator for the development of this application was to seamlessly integrate both front and backend capabilities.
- This application was created to enable users to keep track of events by allowing them to add and delete new notes.
- With the successful completion of this application, it marks a triumphant moment in my journey as a full-stack developer, showcasing proficiency in both front-end and back-end development.
- During the development of the backend, I honed my skills in crafting routes that deliver html files. Additonally, I was able to successfully implement functional GET, POST and DELETE routes.
